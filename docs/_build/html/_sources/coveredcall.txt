Covered Call
============

Covered calls combine long stock with short call options. The short call option by itself, sometimes referred to as naked short call, has the greatest
risk of all the options. But this risk can be offset with long stock. This strategy is often used to generate capital on an existing portfolion of stocks.

Since one option usually controls 100 shares of stock, these spreads are designed to match up stocks against short call options.
