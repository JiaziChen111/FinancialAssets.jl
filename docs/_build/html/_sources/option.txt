Option
======

Options are derivative contracts written against an underlying asset. They come in four flavors depending whether they are calls or puts, and
depending on whether they are short or long.

A call involves the right to purchase, while a put involves the right to sell. These rights are afforded to owners of long options.

A long option is purchased and the risk is limited to the purchase price of the option. A short option is sold (to the purchaser of long
options) and may included unlimited risk. The seller receives a premium for assuming this risk.

Unlimited risk only applies to short calls, since the price of the underlying can theoretically to to infinity. The risk associated with a short
put is nearly identical to the risk associated with owning long stock, except that the premium received offsets this risk. Since an underlying
cannot go below zero, the risk associated with a short put (not considering the premium) is the strike price.
