Butterfly
=========

The butterfly spread involves options of one type, and are constructed in a 1:2:1 ratio with the outer wings of the spread consisting of short options
and the body consisting of long options. The risk of the spread is whatever premium was paid, which is normally small. A normally constructed butterfly 
spread will have equidistance between the body and the outer wings.
