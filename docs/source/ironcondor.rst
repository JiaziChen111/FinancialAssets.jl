Iron Condor
===========

The iron condor is a combination of two sets of spreads: short put spreads, typically with strikes below the market, and short call spreads, 
typically above the current market. Since an underlying cannot be at two prices at the same time, the risk associated with an iron condor is 
equal to the higher of the two short verticals.
